> Due to poor social distancing, Covid-Z has swiftly taken over the world. Now our MC, Mike, has to find his way around without falling victim to the coughing zombies. What was once a simple trip to the corner store has become a perilous journey, with infected hordes lurking around every turn. Mike will need more than just a face mask to survive; he'll have to outsmart the zombies and navigate a world where even a sneeze can spell disaster. Can he make it through without catching more than a cold?
